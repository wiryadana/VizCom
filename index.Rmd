# Hello World

```{r bookcover, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width=4, fig.height=6}
knitr::include_graphics("vizcom_cover.png", dpi = NA)
```

Hello world, this is some of my first book. I always dreamed to be a book writer since I was kid. Thanks to the opportunity given by the boom of open source software and its philosophy, finally I am able to compose this book while being a self sufficient publisher at once.
 
```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'tidyverse', 'ggplot2'
), 'packages.bib')
```
