# Hello World

<img src="vizcom_cover.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Hello world, this is some of my first book. I always dreamed to be a book writer since I was kid. Thanks to the opportunity given by the boom of open source software and its philosophy, finally I am able to compose this book while being a self sufficient publisher at once.
